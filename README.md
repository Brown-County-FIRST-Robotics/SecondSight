# SecondSight

A computer vision project for FRC teams. The intention of this project is to lower the difficulty of AprilTag and object detection using off the shelf cameras and single board computers.

# Getting started
Please see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how to contribute and configuring your Python environment. SecondSight uses Poetry to manage dependencies and builds, VS Code works well as the editor.

# Running the system
To test things out, you can run
```
poetry install
poetry run second-sight
```
which will spit out a URL you can visit to verify the system is working.
